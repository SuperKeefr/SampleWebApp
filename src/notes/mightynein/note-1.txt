Tiberius takes 13 points of damage, halved by Stoneskin, and makes his constitution saving throw, resisting the poison. Vax throws two daggers at the creature, both hitting and dealing a total of 44 damage and 6 damage. Keyleth then uses Thunderwave to push the creature back 15 feet and transforms into an eagle.",
